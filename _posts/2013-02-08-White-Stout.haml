	%p I showed up at Renegade the other day, and they had a new beer!!  Silas, a White Stout..  Unfortunately I barely overheard the brewer explaining the process but missed out on remembering the details.  He wasn't speaking very loud in my defense.  
	%p How was the beer?  Honestly.. My least favorite beer to ever come out of Renegade.  I felt this was a swing and miss.  Yes it tasted like a stout, but just off.  Not sure if it was the color or taste that was off (probably the color).  If it was the color, I would make an analogy of eating something that has always been green and then one day its blue.  Just not right.  The taste was nothing to write home about either.  Sorry Renegade, I will not be having that beer again (unless aged in oak barrels).
